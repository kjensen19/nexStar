Coding Assessment
Build a simple app to show Breweries from the breweries API
[Link](https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries)
Requirements:
    âœ…1. Connect to the API and use the returned data as your initial list
        âœ…1. Display in a list- need to write async promise array based on intial meta query to collect all data
    âœ…2. Should have the ability to
        âœ…1. Create a new Brewery(POST)
        âœ…2. Update a Brewery from the list(PUT)
            âœ…-should be able to reuse most of Add modal, populated with GET info
        âœ…3. View all Brewery data(Detail GET)
        âœ…4. Delete a Brewery from the list(DELETE)
    âœ…3. README


Bonus Points:
    âœ…Use React.js as your frontend framework
    âœ…Use Tailwind CSS
    ðŸ˜…Use TypeScript

Once complete send the source code in a zip file and/or send a link to a source repo with the
code


npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch

Decisions:
    âœ…Authentication (multi-user seems worth, especially if deploying)
    âœ…Stay SPA or add routing?
    âœ…pagination
    âœ…Menu interface
    Add notes?
    Website preview (some don't work, possible security issues are the cons...  the pros are when it works it looks cool)
    âœ…Deploy
    âœ…Mobile
